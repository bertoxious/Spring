# Spring
## Inversion of Control
In contrast with traditional programming, in which our custom code makes calls to a library, IoC enables a framework(in my case Spring) to take control of the flow of a program and make calls to our custom code. To enable this, frameworks use abstractions with additional behavior built in. If we want to add our own behavior, we need to extend the classes of the framework or plugin our own classes.

We can achieve `Inversion of Control` through various mechanisms such as: `Strategy design pattern`, `Service Locator pattern`, `Factory pattern`, and `Dependency Injection (DI)`.
